SuperSense Update Decisions
===========================

### ssupdate.md documents changes and decisions made while updating lexcats and supersenses for words and MWEs tagged with !!@, a stopgap lexcat for tokens that need to be revisited

- 	**stuff** and **thing** are marked as `n.OTHER`, as well as **shit** in the same sense

	> Anyway we drive around in my van and solve mysterys and shit|`n.OTHER`

- 	Deciding between `n.ARTIFACT` and `n.SUBSTANCE`
	- 	`n.ARTIFACT` is used when the object has defined
		
		e.g. desk, door, seat, book, car, building, potpourri

	- 	`n.SUBSTANCE` is used with most mass nouns and objects without hard borders
		
		e.g. drug, paint, shellac, grease, oil, fabric, shampoo

- 	***start*** *to* ***finish*** and ***beginning*** *to* ***end*** are no longer interpreted as MWEs, and both words in both constructions are annotated as `n.TIME`
	
	> start|`n.TIME` to finish|`n.TIME`
	
	> beginning|`n.TIME` to end|`n.TIME`

- 	the character "**#**" is interpreted as being the lexical category `SYM` as opposed to representing the word "number"

- the verb '***do***' was frequently tagged as `v.social` or `v.stative`, and is now `v.change` because it involves an agentive activity. It differs from `v.stative` in that it does not involve a state of being, rather an action. Similarly, it differs from `v.social` in that there often is no social interaction with another person. `v.change` was chosen as the best all-encompassing supsersense.
